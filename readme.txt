This WordPress plugin randomizes the user_id for the user created on WordPress setup,
removing one potential attack factor from the site.

It also randomizes the ID for all other users created after its setup. At this moment,
this feature requires the patch from WP Issue https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40545
